# Hello!

I am Luke Eldridge, a software engineer based out of Portland, Oregon. I have used several different languages in my career so far, including javascript, C#, golang, objective-c, ruby, and others. I have worked professionally on web apps and desktop apps for both MacOS and Windows. I pride myself on being able to pick up and learn whatever tools I need to solve a problem.
