# Hello!

I am Luke Eldridge, a software engineer based out of Portland, Oregon. I have used several different languages in my career so far, including javascript, C#, golang, objective-c, ruby, and others. I have worked professionally on web apps and desktop apps for both MacOS and Windows.

I am currently focusing on working with ReactJS, NodeJS, or Go based stacks, but I pride myself on being able to use whatever tool is necessary to get a job done.
