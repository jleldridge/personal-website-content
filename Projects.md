## Abstract

Abstract is a tool that leverages the
power of version control to allow design teams to collaborate and more
effectively hand design assets off to developers. While at Abstract I
worked on the full stack of the app, from adding server and desktop
code to parse and version control design documents, to bringing our
own designs to life in the UX on the web and desktop apps.

## Datawatch Monarch

Monarch is Datawatch's premier self-service data preparation tool
targeting Windows desktops. While working at Datawatch, I have
designed and developed UI workflows and backend code for data
extraction methods, data connectors, data transforms, joins, and
more. I have also helped to integrate Monarch with Datawatch's _Monarch Swarm_
server / browser based product.

## Panopticon

Following their acquisition by Datawatch, I worked on-site with
Panopticon Software in Stockholm to bring Panopticonâ€™s data
visualization software into the Datawatch software suite. During
this time I was primarily focused on improving the software's UI,
but I also created UI and backend code for data connectors that
allow Datawatch software to connect to IBM Cognos TM1, IBM Cloudant,
and streaming data sources. I primarily used C# and XAML, but there
were occasions where I worked on backend code written in Java.

## Scrawler

Scrawler is a note taking / drawing app I designed primarily for the
Microsoft Surface line of tablets. It was mostly intended for
personal use, as I was dissatisfied with many of the free drawing
apps offered for the Surface. The app never made it to the stage
where I could polish the visuals, but it was eventually
feature-complete enough to use it both to take notes, and to sketch
and export the icons used in the app itself (hence the sketchy
appearance of the icons).

## Amoeboid

Amoeboid is the working name of a simple browser game that I created
using vanilla javascript. The game was inspired by an old flash game
I used to play in school called Hungry Space. The goal of the game
is to eat (via collision) everything smaller than you while avoiding
everything larger than you. Movement is accomplished with the WASD
keys and I payed particular attention to trying to capture the
slippery effect of movement in a low friction environment to add
challenge and finesse to the controls. As the player eats more
enemies, they gradually become larger, making more enemies edible,
but also making it more difficult to maneuver around larger enemies.
The game is won when there are no more enemies large enough to eat
the player.

## This Website

I developed this website for deployment on AWS Lightsail with NodeJS as the backend
and ReactJS and Bootstrap as the frontend. The content for this website is written in
markdown files so that it can be easily updated separately from the server and UI code.
